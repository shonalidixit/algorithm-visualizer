Algorithm Visualizer: 
An interactive, web-based application that demonstrates the inner workings of 11 classic algorithms with animated step-by-step visualizations and textual explanations.

Features: 
Supports sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort.

1) Includes searching algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search.

2) Visualizes graph algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's shortest path.

3) Demonstrates a dynamic programming example: Fibonacci sequence calculation.

4) User-friendly pastel-themed UI with responsive input forms.

5) Shows active algorithm steps with highlighted data elements and descriptive captions.

6) Outputs final sorted array, search results, traversal order, or computed values.

7) Backend implemented in C++ for efficient algorithm computation.

8) Frontend in JavaScript/HTML/CSS handling input, animation, and output display.

9) Leverages JSON for frontend-backend communication.

Usage:
1) Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.

2) Enter the algorithm-specific input data.

3) Click "Generate Steps & Animate" to see your algorithm in action with step-by-step animations and explanations.

4) View the final output beside the input on screen.

Tech Stack: 
1) C++ (algorithm backend)

2) JavaScript, HTML, CSS (frontend UI & animations)

3) JSON (data interchange format)

Purpose
This project serves as an educational tool to help better understand how fundamental algorithms operate internally. It is useful for students, educators, and anyone looking to grasp algorithm logic through interactive visualization
